# ALS-Diagnosis-DFNN

Project Overview

This project involves the application of various statistical, mathematical, and machine learning techniques to analyze and classify data from the "Minsk2020_ALS_dataset.csv" dataset. The primary goal is to predict the diagnosis of ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) using a Deep Feedforward Neural Network (DFNN) and evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
